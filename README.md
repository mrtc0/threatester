# Threatester

Threatester is a Kubernetes Operator for testing threat detection.  

## âš  WARNING

Threatester is currently under active development and is not suited for any production environment.

## Description

![](docs/img/workload.png)

threatester allows you to create a custom resource called a scenario. When you create a scenario with a specified threat scenario, threatester executes it and confirms whether it triggers an alert in your SIEM.  
This allows you to perform continuous and declarative security testing.

Here is an example scenario manifest:

```yaml
# Expect Datadog Monitor alert ID 12345 into an 'Alert' state
apiVersion: threatester.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: Scenario
metadata:
  name: scenario-sample
spec:
  templates:
    - name: access-sa-token
      container:
        name: 'access-sa-token'
        image: alpine
        command: ['cat', '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token']
  expectations:
    - timeout: 10s
      datadog:
        monitor:
          id: "12345"
          status: Alert
```
